Using binary expression trees, write an infix expression parser. Here are a few examples of
expressions your program should parse and evaluate.

1) (Weight: 40%) Your parser should parse an infix expression that supports the following
arithmetic and logical operators with the specified precedencies.

2) (Weight: 30%) Parse an expression given in a string format. Your program should be flexible
with the given expressions. For instance, "1+2" is the same as "1 + 2". The user should not
worry about writing the spaces between operands and operators.

3) (Weight: 20%) Evaluate the given expression efficiently.

4) (Weight: 10%) Your main() program should ask the user to enter an expression via keyboard,
then output the evaluation result to the standard console (screen).

5) (Weight: Extra 10%) Use GitHub to manage your project.

Facts and Assumptions

1) You may assume that all operands are integers.

2) For divisions, you need to get the integer result (e.g. "3 / 2" should be evaluated to 1 instead
of 1.5).

3) The result of a comparison is a boolean. However, a boolean can be converted to an integer
according to the logic of true = 1 and false = 0. Also, an integer can be converted to a
boolean according to the logic that a number equal to zero is false; otherwise, it is true.

4) Take a look at the algorithm in the following link for inspiration. The algorithm constructs a
binary expression tree from a postfix expression. In this project, however, you are required to
build the tree from an infix expression.

5) You can assume that the users always input valid expressions. However, if the input expression
to be evaluated is "3 / (6 * 5 âˆ’ 30)", your program should prompt the user that there is a
divide-by-zero error, instead of a crash.
